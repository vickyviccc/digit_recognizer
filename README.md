Dataset
The dataset can be accessed from the Kaggle competition page: Digit Recognizer and can be found in the directory "data". 

The dataset includes:
train.csv: The training set with pixel values and corresponding digit labels.
test.csv: The test set with pixel values only.
sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file for Kaggle.


Project Structure: 
notebook - Contains Jupyter notebooks with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md - Project description and documentation.
submission.csv - Final predictions formatted for Kaggle submission with the ImageId and Label columns.


Features and Approach:


Data Preprocessing:
Rescaling of pixel values.
Converting images to grayscale.
Reshaping images to a 28x28 format if necessary for compatibility with deep learning models.


Model Training:
Implemented baseline models like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine.
Advanced models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search and Optuna for deep learning models.
Model Performance
The final CNN model achieved high accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating effective classification performance on handwritten digits. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, and recall.

Results:
The final predictions are saved in submission.csv, formatted for Kaggle submission with the ImageId and Label columns.
